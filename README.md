# Secure Document Management System with S3

This repository contains a CloudFormation template that implements a secure, compliant document management system using Amazon S3. The solution is designed to meet stringent security, compliance, and retention requirements for government agencies.

## Architecture Overview

The solution implements:
- Primary S3 bucket with versioning and object lock for document storage
- Secondary S3 bucket in a different region for backup and disaster recovery
- KMS encryption for both buckets
- Cross-region replication for redundancy
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Integration capabilities with S3 Storage Browser

## How This Solution Meets Customer Requirements

### Volume & Scalability
- S3 provides virtually unlimited storage capacity
- Initial 10-15 TB requirement easily accommodated
- Scales automatically for future growth
- Cost-effective with lifecycle policies moving older data to STANDARD_IA storage

### Security & Compliance
- HIPAA and CPRA compliance supported through:
  - Server-side encryption using KMS
  - Versioning enabled to prevent accidental deletions
  - Object Lock for retention policies
  - Public access blocked by default
  - Audit trails via CloudTrail (can be enabled)
  - Integration with IAM for role-based access control

### Data Protection & Retention
- Object Lock enforces retention policies (100-year retention configured)
- Versioning prevents accidental deletions
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Protection against ransomware through versioning and immutable backups

### Access Control
- Supports integration with S3 Storage Browser for:
  - Role-based access control
  - Read-only access for closed cases
  - Admin override capabilities
  - Folder-based permissions

### Organization & Usability
- Supports hierarchical folder structure (e.g., case numbers)
- Compatible with S3 Storage Browser for:
  - Intuitive user interface
  - Metadata management
  - Search capabilities
  - File upload/download

### Integration & Remote Access
- Can integrate with:
  - County authentication systems via IAM
  - VPN solutions
  - S3 Storage Browser for frontend access
  - Future case management systems through S3 APIs

## Implementation Guide

1. Deploy the CloudFormation template:
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name document-management --template-body file://template.yaml --parameters ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=prod
```

2. Configure S3 Storage Browser to use the created buckets

3. Set up IAM roles and policies for:
   - Regular users (read/write to specific folders)
   - Admins (full access)
   - System processes (replication, lifecycle)

4. Implement backup monitoring and alerting

5. Document retention policies in accordance with requirements

## Security Considerations

- All buckets have public access blocked
- Data is encrypted at rest using KMS
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- Versioning enabled to prevent data loss
- Object Lock enabled for retention enforcement

## Cost Optimization

- Lifecycle policies move data to STANDARD_IA after 90 days
- Consider enabling Intelligent-Tiering for optimal cost management
- Monitor storage metrics and adjust policies as needed

## Monitoring & Maintenance

Recommended monitoring:
- S3 bucket metrics
- Replication status
- Access patterns
- Storage costs
- Security events

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging
- S3 Inventory for asset management
- S3 Analytics for storage optimization
- Additional backup regions
- Enhanced metadata tagging system
